osgPhysX
=============

The osgPhysX project focuses on the integration of OpenSceneGraph and NVIDIA PhysX. The main purpose
is to integrate and demonstrate physics-based rigid, soft bodies, clothes, particles and vehicles in
3D scene, all of which are well supported by the powerful PhysX engine.

Installation
------------

0. Dependencies
* OpenSceneGraph (version 3.0 or later): http://www.openscenegraph.com
* NVIDIA PhysX (version 3.3 or later): http://developer.nvidia.com/physx-downloads
* DirectX SDK (for DirectInput to work, which is used by the internal OIS library for buffered inputs)

1. Use CMake (or cmake-gui) to build makefiles or solutions
# cmake <recipe_dir> -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Release -DCMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX=<install_dir>

2. Run 'make' to build and install all recipes
# make
# make install

3. Have fun!

Examples
------------

character_controller_test:
Move a character on complex ground and environment, which is useful in FPS games and simulations.
Press '2' to change to first-person mode first, and press Ctrl + mouse dragging to walk.

physics_vehicle_test:
Move a 4-wheel vehicle on complex ground and environment. Also shows how to create simple physics boxes 
and particles. Use arrow keys to move the vehicle and see how the racing engine works.
